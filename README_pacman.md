Title: Pacman - linear X-axis movement excercise with direction reversal

Description: This is one of my first JS projects, the purpose was to create a pacman animation using 4 different
images. The refresh rate for the moving pacman is 300ms. It moves from left to right and reverses direction upon
hiting the edge of your browser window.

How to open: just open the index.html on your browser.

Usage: To start the animation, click on the pacman and it'll start moving. No need to do anything afterwards.
